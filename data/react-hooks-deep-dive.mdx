React Hooks have fundamentally changed how we write React components, bringing state and lifecycle features to functional components. They provide a more direct API to React concepts you already know and enable powerful composition patterns.

## Why React Hooks?

Hooks provide a more direct API to React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. They solve many common problems in React development.

1.  **Simpler Logic** - No more complex class hierarchies and this keyword confusion
2.  **Reusability** - Share stateful logic between components without changing component hierarchy
3.  **Cleaner Components** - Separate concerns and organize related logic together

## Popular Hooks

- **useState** - Manage component state with simple setter functions
- **useEffect** - Handle side effects like API calls, subscriptions, and DOM manipulation
- **useContext** - Access context values without nested consumers
- **useReducer** - Manage complex state logic with Redux-like patterns
- **useMemo & useCallback** - Optimize performance by memoizing expensive computations

## Custom Hooks

Create your own hooks to extract and reuse stateful logic:

```javascript
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
  return { count, increment, decrement };
}
```

## Conclusion

React Hooks make your code more readable, reusable, and maintainable. They're the modern way to build React applications, providing better composition patterns and eliminating many common pain points of class components.
